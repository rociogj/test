## Introduction

Steps to run this project


## Installation

In order to get started you have to make sure that you have Node and npm installed.
Open your command shell and write down:
> npm install -g grunt-cli

To install grunt globally. (skip this ste, if you already have grunt installed)

We also need bower in this project, run:
> npm install -g bower

(skip this step, if you already have bower installed)

Once you have this one, go to the project's root directory and install project dependencies with:
> npm install

then:
> bower install

to install the project dependencies listed in bower.json
and finally run grunt:
> grunt serve or grunt build

grunt serve
- to generate pre folder and open the browser

grunt build

Here you go!
